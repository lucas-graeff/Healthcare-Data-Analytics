Included in this folder:
	- The data stored in SQL Tables (filename.Table.sql)
	- Queries that clean/aggregate the data and prepare it for analysis (cleaned_.sql)
	- Aggregrated Queries for Descriptive Analysis
	- PDF of current PowerBI Visualizations of Aggregated Data
	- CSV's used for Linear Regression Models (suicide_by_state.csv & suicide_by_agegroup.csv)
	- Python Source Code for Linear Regression Models
	- Screenshots of the Linear Regression Model Outputs

Notes:

The suicide_mortality_by_state_yearly table will not export from SQL Server. I included the CSV which can be easily imported into a SQL Table if you want to examine the data.
