Included in this folder:
	- The data stored in SQL Tables (filename.Table.sql)
	- Queries that clean/aggregate the data and prepare it for analysis (cleaned_.sql)

The suicide_mortality_by_state_yearly table will not export from SQL Server. I included the CSV which can be easily imported into a SQL Table if you want to examine the data.
